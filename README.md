# Cover letter generator ‚úç

I'm planning to utilize Engineering and OpenAI's API to streamline the process of crafting a cover letter, which can often be a challenging and time-consuming task, by generating one based on the company's profile and the specific job position.

### Structure of the cover letter
- Opening statement: Introduce yourself and tell how you came to know about the job.
- Personal values: Mention what you have gained in your previous role and how it will make you a good asset for them.
- Convey enthusiasm: Always make it clear why you want this job and try to make it seem like your dream job.
- Show: Mention one or two points to directly point out what will you bring to the table.
- Tone: Don't sound desperate for the job even if you areüòÇ
